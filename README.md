# NotesManager

This is my react app wrote fully with typescript. I used solutions such as modals and own 
hooks to make it works perfectly simple with the rules of clean code.

You can run this app in your browser and use it as a tool for managing notes. It allows you 
to create notes with titles and tags, edit them, edit tags, delete them, delete tags and simply 
search through all your notes basing on title and tags. 

Happy noting ;))
